                        Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance:
                        a play, opera, mime, ballet, etc., performed in a theatre, or on
                        radio or television.[1] Considered as a genre of poetry in
                        general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and
                        the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's Poetics (c. 335 BC)—the
                        earliest work of dramatic theory.[2] The term "drama" comes from a
                        Greek word "draō" meaning "to do / to act" (Classical Greek:
                        δρᾶμα, drama), which is derived from "I do" (Classical Greek:
                        δράω, drao). The two masks associated with drama represent the
                        traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. In
                        English (as was the analogous case in many other European
                        languages), the word play or game.

                        Comedy (from the Greek: κωμῳδία, kōmōdía) is a genre of fiction
                        that consists of discourses or works intended to be humorous or
                        amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, film,
                        stand-up comedy, television, radio, books, or any other
                        entertainment medium. The term originated in ancient Greece: in
                        Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by
                        political satire performed by comic poets in theaters.[1] The
                        theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic
                        performance pitting two groups, ages, genders, or societies
                        against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye
                        depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth".

                        A documentary film or documentary is a non-fictional
                        motion-picture intended to "document reality, primarily for the
                        purposes of instruction, education, or maintaining a historical
                        record".[1] Bill Nichols has characterised the documentary in
                        terms of "a filmmaking practice, a cinematic tradition, and mode
                        of audience reception [that remains] a practice without clear
                        boundaries".[2] Early documentary films, originally called
                        "actuality films", lasted one minute or less. Over time,
                        documentaries have evolved to become longer in length, and to
                        include more categories; some examples being: educational,
                        observational, and docufiction. Documentaries are very informative
                        and are often used within schools, as a resource to teach various
                        principles.

                        Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or
                        game[1] that aims to use, maintain or improve physical ability and
                        skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some
                        cases, entertainment to spectators.[2] Sports can, through casual
                        or organized participation, improve one's physical health.
                        Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants,
                        through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants,
                        either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports
                        such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or
                        consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match)
                        is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some
                        sports allow.

                        The fantastic requires the fulfillment of three conditions. First,
                        the text must oblige the reader to consider the world of the
                        characters as a world of living persons and to hesitate between a
                        natural or supernatural explanation of the events described.
                        Second, this hesitation may also be experienced by a character;
                        thus the reader's role is so to speak entrusted to a character,
                        and at the same time the hesitation is represented, it becomes one
                        of the themes of the work—in the case of naive reading, the actual
                        reader identifies himself with the character. Third, the reader
                        must adopt a certain attitude with regard to the text: he will
                        reject allegorical as well as "poetic" interpretations
